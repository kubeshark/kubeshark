 * When using `maxAgeSeconds`, requests may be used *once* after expiring
 * because the expiration clean up will not have occurred until *after* the
 * cached request has been used. If the request has a "Date" header, then
 * a light weight expiration check is performed and the request will not be
 * used immediately.
 *
 * When using `maxEntries`, the entry least-recently requested will be removed
 * from the cache first.
