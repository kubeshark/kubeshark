<!--
Thank you for reporting an issue!

Remember, this issue tracker is for reporting issues ONLY with node-gyp.

If you have an issue installing a specific module, please file an issue on
that module's issue tracker (`npm issues modulename`). Open issue here only if
you are sure this is an issue with node-gyp, not with the module you are
trying to build.

Fill out the form below. We probably won't investigate an issue that does not
provide the basic information we require.

-->

* **Node Version**: <!-- `node -v` and `npm -v` -->
* **Platform**: <!-- `uname -a` (UNIX), or `systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version" /C:"System Type"` (Windows) -->
* **Compiler**: <!-- `cc -v` (UNIX) or `msbuild /version & cl` (Windows) -->
* **Module**: <!-- what you tried to build/install -->

<details><summary>Verbose output (from npm or node-gyp):</summary>
