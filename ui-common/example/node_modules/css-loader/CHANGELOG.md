### Features

* allow to disable css modules and **disable their by default** ([#842](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/issues/842)) ([889dc7f](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/commit/889dc7f))
* disable `import` option doesn't affect on `composes` ([#822](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/issues/822)) ([f9aa73c](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/commit/f9aa73c))
* allow to filter `urls` ([#856](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/issues/856)) ([5e702e7](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/commit/5e702e7))
* allow to filter `import` at-rules ([#857](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/issues/857)) ([5e6034c](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/commit/5e6034c))
* emit warning on invalid `urls()` ([#832](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/issues/832)) ([da95db8](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/commit/da95db8))
* added `exportOnlyLocals` option ([#824](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/issues/824)) ([e9327c0](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/commit/e9327c0))
* reuse `postcss` ast from other loaders (i.e `postcss-loader`) ([#840](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/issues/840)) ([1dad1fb](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/commit/1dad1fb))
* schema options ([b97d997](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/commit/b97d997))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* resolving logic for `url()` and `import` at-rules works the same everywhere, it does not matter whether css modules are enabled (with `global` and `local` module) or not. Examples - `url('image.png')` as `require('./image.png')`, `url('./image.png')` as `require('./image.png')`, `url('~module/image.png')` as `require('module/image.png')`.
* by default css modules are disabled (now `modules: false` disable all css modules features), you can return old behaviour change this on `modules: 'global'`
* `css-loader/locals` was dropped in favor `exportOnlyLocals` option
* `import` option only affect on `import` at-rules and doesn't affect on `composes` declarations
* invalid `@import` at rules now emit warnings
* use `postcss@7`
