**Kubeshark** is an API Traffic Analyzer for [**Kubernetes**](https://kubernetes.io/) providing real-time, protocol-level visibility into Kubernetesâ€™ internal network, capturing and monitoring all traffic and payloads going in, out and across containers, pods, nodes and clusters.

![Simple UI](https://github.com/kubeshark/assets/raw/master/png/kubeshark-ui.png)

Think [TCPDump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcpdump) and [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) re-invented for Kubernetes

## Getting Started

Download **Kubeshark**'s binary distribution [latest release](https://github.com/kubeshark/kubeshark/releases/latest) and run following one of these examples:

```shell
kubeshark tap
```

```shell
kubeshark tap -n sock-shop "(catalo*|front-end*)"
```

Running any of the :point_up: above commands will open the [Web UI](https://docs.kubeshark.co/en/ui) in your browser which streams the traffic in your Kubernetes cluster in real-time.

### Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) :beer: users can add Kubeshark formulae with:

```shell
brew tap kubeshark/kubeshark
```

and install Kubeshark CLI with:

```shell
brew install kubeshark
```
